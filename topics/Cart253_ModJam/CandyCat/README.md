# CandyCat

A game of catching candy and finding balance to not get caught
  
 Instructions:
 Click to begin the game and click to launch your paw in order to catch the candy!
 The different colored candies have different amount of points assigned, and you get fatter the more candy you eat!
 But is this game about catching as much as you can before time runs out, or is it trying to teach you
 a lesson? SPOILER! The only way to win is to find a good balance of candy to eat. There are three
 possible ednings.
