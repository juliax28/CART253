# Planning

## Starting point

The initial idea:

> Cat eats candy, but we must find the balance of candy and size to win

## Experience design

The experience:

> The user controls a frog at the bottom of the screen, they can shoot out the frog's tongue and catch a fly which is moving on the screen. If the tongue hits the fly it gets eaten.

## Breaking it down

Basic things to do:


WHAT I NEED:
Opening state with the witch leaving image
Change the frog to a cat
Change flies to candy
Have three diff types of candy
Make cat interact with candy
Have a timer that counts down, eventually leading to witch being back (play sound + countdown)
Which in turn triggers the win or lose screens depending on the states of candy eaten + cat weight
Win if: right ratio of candy to weight basically
