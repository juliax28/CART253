A cat catching mice (paw jumps up and catches the mice)
As the cat catches mice it……
Gets fatter and turns into a ‘fat cat’, represents greed, gets a collar and a monocle LOL
Starts out skinny and sad
Grows fat and gluttonous
Gets too fat, has a heart attack
‘Harmful’ something … that can heal him if he gets too fat


If (mice = certain amount){
	Draw monocle}
If (mice = certain amount) {
	Draw collar and top hat}
As mice score increases, size of cat grows

Refining Idea.....

HALLOWEEN CAT
Game intro pain: cat sees witch leaving (still frame)…. Game starts! (Second state)
Catch mice before the witch returns! ‘Magical’ mice make you grow more… but wait, grow too big and you trigger the state where when the timer runs out and the witch comes back,,, you’re too fat to fit in the whole and the witch finds you! (again, just a still screen)...
But…
If you manage to catch as many mice as possible as well as the magical ones that make you SHRINK… then you can fit in the hole when the witch comes back… and you trigger the winning screen (Another state)
