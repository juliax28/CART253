## Description
Oh no! You've fallen into the dungeons with seemingly no way out. But this is a video game, after all, and videogames come with a way out, right? As an immortal vampire, navigate through the perilous dungeon paths on your journey out, all without ever truly dying. Spoiler alert, there is no way out. The game restarts, bringing you back to the start after hitting rock bottom again and again. How many times will you try to escape before giving up? HINT: this isn't just about vampires and dungeons. 

The idea is to give the player a sense of futile effort, a reflection on how we often feel trapped within our circumstances. The vampire's immortality now feels like a burden.
